## Purpose
The purpose of this software is to allow users to be able to create a personalized list of anime by browsing through a database of anime. Users can create an anime list, add anime to their list, delete anime from their list, add ratings and reviews for an anime, and update any items on their anime list.  
  
This software is interesting, because it can be helpful for people who like anime and want to keep track of all the anime that they have watched. An existing product that is like the project that is being proposed is https://anilist.co/.  On this website users can also create personalized anime lists.
